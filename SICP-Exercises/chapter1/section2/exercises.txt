# 1.9 --> One is a recursive process and the other is an iterative process.
They are both Recursive procedures but the scheme interpreter is tail-recursive
and can handle the iterative process as linear.

(A 1 10) = 1024
(A 2 4) == (A 3 3) == 65536

(define (f n) (A 0 n)) --> 2*n
(define (f n) (A 1 n)) --> 2^n
(define (f n) (A 2 n)) --> 2^(2^(n-1))
